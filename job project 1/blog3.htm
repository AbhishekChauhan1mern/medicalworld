            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p>HIV remains one of the most serious global health threats of our time. in 2017, 1.8 million people were
                infected with HIV, and 940,000 died of AIDS-rekated causes.</p>
            <p>We believe we can end the AIDS epidemic. Between 2010 and 2019, there had been a 23% decline in new HIV
                infections globally. More people are getting tratment than ever before. By keeping the focus on the
                needs and right of key populations, we can prevent new HIV infections and ensure those living with AIDS
                are not left behind. This is what Pathfinder does.</p>

            <p>Globally,38million people are living with HIV-68% of these in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite concerted
                efforts to stem the HIV epidemic there, disparities in response are evident among countries,
                feographical locations, populations, and communities. Women and girls comprise 63% of HIV cases, with
                adolescent girls and young women three times more likely to be infected thanmen and boys of the dame
                age.</p>

            <p>Headwinds and shocks including insufficient polotical will, frail health system, weak support for
                community- based organizations, punitivr laws, user fees, COVID-19,conflict,insecurity, and humanitarian
                crises continue to threaten and revrse progress.
                Resourses avaliable for HIV from mother to child. Deliver compreshensive care to people living with HIV
                and their families at timess and locations that are convenient to them. Support key
                populations-including men who have sex with men,prisoners, female sex workers, and transgender women-to
                make sure they can exercise their rights and receive quality services free from stigma, discrimination,
                or judgment. Promote efficent testing- in communities, facilities, and hotspots- so people know their
                status and can intiate treatment as early as possible, a key aspect of UNAIDS'95-95-95 goals.
            </p>

            <p>Decentralize HIV services to communities and low -tier health setting so more people in more
                places-especially adolescents, men, and those lost=to-follow-up-have access to the services they need.
                integrate HIV services with other swxual and reproductive health interventions, recognizing the
                opportunityy to meet people's needs in a single visit. Challenge restrictive policies and inspire
                governments to uphold the rights of people living with HIV, especially key populations, adolescents, and
                women.</p>
