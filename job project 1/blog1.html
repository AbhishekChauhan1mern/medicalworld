            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            The eyes are not just the windows to the soul but also gateways to various infections. One such common
            infection that affects millions each year is the dreaded "Eye Flu." Known as conjunctivitis in medical
            terms, this contagious ocular infection can cause discomfort and hinder daily life. In this blog, we will
            delve into the world of eye flu, understanding its causes, symptoms, prevention, and treatment options to
            keep your eyes healthy and happy.

            <h3> What is Eye Flu?</h3>
            Eye flu, or conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin and transparent layer covering
            the eye's white part and the eyelids' inner surface. The condition can be caused by viruses, bacteria,
            allergies, or even irritants like smoke and dust. The most common types are viral and bacterial
            conjunctivitis, with viral being highly contagious and bacterial requiring prompt treatment to prevent
            complications.

            <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
            Eye flu manifests through a range of symptoms, which may vary depending on the cause. Some of the common
            signs include:

            Redness in the whites of the eyes
            Itchy or burning sensation
            Excessive tearing
            Sensitivity to light
            Discharge from the eyes, which can be watery or thick and colored (yellow or green)
            Crusty eyelids upon waking up (common in bacterial conjunctivitis)
            Blurred vision (rare but possible)
            <h3> How Does Eye Flu Spread?</h3>
            Eye flu is highly contagious and can spread through direct or indirect contact with infected eye secretions.
            This means that touching or rubbing your eyes after being in contact with an infected person or using
            contaminated objects like towels, can transmit the infection. The virus or bacteria can also be transferred
            through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The causes of viral conjunctivitis can be acknowledged
            to the monsoon, change in temperature owing to the hot and humid climate that invites virus growth, and lack
            of eye hygiene.

            <h3> Prevention Tips</h3>
            To protect yourself and others from eye flu, follow these simple prevention tips:

            Practice Good Hygiene: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially
            after touching your face, blowing your nose, or interacting with someone who has eye flu.
            Avoid Touching Your Eyes: Refrain from touching or rubbing your eyes, as it can introduce infections into
            the delicate eye area.
            Personal Items: Avoid sharing personal items like towels, pillowcases, and eye makeup with others.
            Stay Home: If you have eye flu, stay home from work, school, or public places until you are no longer
            contagious to prevent spreading the infection.
            Disinfect Surfaces: Regularly clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces in your home and workplace.
            Use Protective Eyewear: If you work in environments with potential eye irritants, wear protective eyewear to
            reduce the risk of infections.
            Treatment Options
            Treatment for eye flu depends on the cause:

            Viral Conjunctivitis: Viral eye flu is self-limiting and usually goes away on its own within a week or two.
            Applying warm compresses to the eyes can alleviate discomfort. Artificial tears can also help soothe
            irritation.
            Bacterial Conjunctivitis: Bacterial eye flu requires medical attention, as antibiotics are often prescribed
            to clear the infection. Be sure to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor.
            Allergic Conjunctivitis: For eye flu caused by allergies, antihistamine eye drops or oral antihistamines can
            provide relief. Avoiding known allergens is crucial in managing this type of conjunctivitis.
            Irritant Conjunctivitis: If the eye flu is caused by irritants like chemicals or smoke, flushing the eyes
            with water can help remove the offending substance. Seek medical attention if the irritation persists.
            When to Seek Medical Attention
            While most cases of eye flu can be managed at home, there are instances when immediate medical atten</p>
